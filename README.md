# About me
![MeLanguages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=HasiukI&theme=blue-green) ![MeStats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=HasiukI&theme=blue-green) 

I like programming. It makes me feel like I can do anything. If it's useful to others, it gives me a sense of purpose. I also like to escape from everyday life and play a game. My taste ranges from Minecraft to Elden Ring. When it comes to music, I like electronic music, but in principle, the situation is similar to what happens with games. Recent songs I've listened to include "Pisse - Fahrradsattel," "M83 'Midnight City'," and "Mr. Forgettable." In fact, you can ask me anything else!
